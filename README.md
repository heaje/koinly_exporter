# Scripts for creating koinly.io CSV imports
[koinly.io](https://koinly.io) is a useful tool for tracking multiple crypto assets in one place.  Unfortunately, it does not support reading from every blockchain (that would be impossible).

The purpose of these scripts is to read from blockchains not supported by Koinly and put all the transactions in the CSV format supported by Koinly.  It is then a simple task to import the CSV in Koinly and track your crypto assets for non-supported blockchains.

## Supported Blockchains
This list will grow as needed.  Any blockchains later supported by Koinly will eventually be removed from this list.

* Ravencoin

## Planned Blockchain support
These are blockchains that are planned to be supported.

* Raptoreum
